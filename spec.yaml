  description: >
    The concept of a mechanic is related to the idea of game mechanics. In Tome a mechanic is 
    a collection of related variables. A mechanic is considered active or inactive. A mechanic's 
    state is determined by a collection of true or false variables. When all of those variables 
    are true, then the mechanic is active. If one of those varibles becomes false then the 
    mechanic is changed to an inactive state. When a mechanic is active, then its variables are 
    available in the programming environment (the engine.) And when the mechanic is inactive, 
    those variables are inaccessible.

    A variable is the basic element of programming in the Tome engine. A variable represents a 
    piece of data that may change over time. Variables may be declared in many places. While 
    many variables may be defined in a Tome sheet, they may not all be active. Only active 
    variables may be used by programs, widgets, or other Tome elements. There are a number of 
    different situations where variables may be activated.
